Revision history for App-SetScreensaver-Timeout

0.08    2015-01-08 (PERLANCAR)

	- To avoid having to '>/dev/null' everytime we set screensaver
	  timeout in a script, the current timeout value is moved to result
	  metadata 'func.timeout' which can be viewed using --json.


0.07    2014-12-08 (PERLANCAR)

	- Change ordering of detection, detect processes
	  gnome-screensaver/xscreensaver first before detecting by desktop
	  type, since it's possible to run KDE but still use xscreensaver
	  (which I'm planning to do BTW).


0.06    2014-12-03 (PERLANCAR)

	- [ux] Accept second/sec/s unit, check unit, return current value
	  (even when no arg is set).


0.05    2014-11-30 (PERLANCAR)

        - No functional changes.

0.04    2014-11-30 (PERLANCAR)
